    <h2>Recipe Instructions</h2>

    <h3>Prepare the Chicken</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Butterfly the Chicken, Start with a thick chicken breast. Cut towards the straight side of the chicken breast, to open it like a book. This helps avoid large holes in the chicken when you butterfly it.</li>
        <li>Pound the Chicken, Lay some plastic film on your wet cutting board.  Place the chicken on a wet cutting board (for grip). Using a meat mallet, gently pound the thicker parts of the chicken to ensure even cooking. Avoid using the rough side of the mallet to prevent tearing the meat.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour, ensuring all parts are covered. Then dip it in the beaten eggs mixed with lemon zest. Lastly, coat the chicken with the panko breadcrumbs. Make sure each layer adheres well to the chicken to avoid breadcrumbs falling off during frying.</li>
        <li>Heat the Clarified Butter to 330 Degrees Fahrenheit. Gently place the chicken into the hot butter and fry it until golden brown. Turn the heat down after flipping the chicken to ensure even cooking. Once cooked, remove the schnitzel and place it on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the Potato Salad</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes in salted water with their skin on. Once cooked, remove them from the boiling water and place them in cold water. </li>
        <li>After the potatoes have cooled down enough to handle, peel them and cut them into pieces.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, make a dressing by combining Dijon mustard, sherry vinegar, warm chicken stock, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Toss the potatoes with the red onion and the dressing. Adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the Cucumber Salad</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine sour cream, dill, white balsamic vinegar, and sugar. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add in the sliced cucumber and mix well. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    
    </ol>
